## Agrobloom : Smart Agriculture System**

This project aims to revolutionize agriculture by leveraging machine learning to provide intelligent solutions for farmers. The system offers two primary functionalities:

1. **Crop Recommendation:**
   * Analyzes soil and weather data to identify suitable crops for specific regions.
   * Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict optimal crop choices based on historical data and current conditions.
   * Provides farmers with tailored recommendations to maximize yield and profitability.

2. **Disease Detection and Treatment:**
   * Employs image processing and computer vision techniques to detect plant diseases from visual symptoms.
   * Offers accurate diagnosis and suggests appropriate treatments to prevent crop loss.
   * Integrates real-time data on disease outbreaks and provides timely alerts to farmers.

### **Features**

* **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface allows farmers to easily input data and receive recommendations.
* **Data-Driven Approach:** The system relies on data-driven analysis to ensure accurate and reliable results.
* **Real-Time Integration:** Real-time weather and soil data are incorporated to provide up-to-date recommendations.
* **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Advanced machine learning techniques are employed for crop recommendation and disease detection.
* **Disease Diagnosis:** Image processing and computer vision are used to identify plant diseases.

### **Technologies Used**

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning Libraries:** Tensorflow, Pytorch
* **Data Processing:**  Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Algorithms:** CNN, Randomforest
* **User Interface:** Flask
* **Deployment:**  local server


### **Usage**
Crop Recommendation
Data Input: Farmers will need to fill out a form with the following necessary details:

Soil pH level
Rainfall amount
Temperature range
Existing crop rotation practices
Any specific preferences or constraints
Submission: Once the form is filled, the farmer can submit the data.

Output: The system will process the input data and generate a list of suitable crops for the specified region and environmental conditions. The recommendations will consider factors such as soil fertility, water availability, and climate suitability.

Disease Detection
Image Upload: Farmers can upload an image of the affected plant leaves.

Disease Detection: The system will employ image processing and computer vision techniques to analyze the image and identify potential diseases. This process will be performed in a fraction of seconds.

Treatment Suggestions: Based on the detected disease, the system will automatically suggest appropriate medications or treatment methods. The recommendations will be tailored to the specific disease and the severity of the symptoms.
